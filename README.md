## Starting

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites have to be fulfilled before trying to start the application.
A Docker Compose file is also provided for convenience.

#### Rust Nightly

```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

#### MariaDB

A running MariaDB instance with properly configured user and database as a main database.

#### PostgreSQL

A running PostgreSQL instance with properly configured user and database for scheduling.

#### Mailhog

Mailhog or similar SMTP endpoint to support email sending and 2FA.

#### Redis

A running Redis server for publisher/subscriber functionality.

### Start the backend

```bash
cargo -Z unstable-options -C ./ watch -c -w src -x run
```

### Start the frontend

By default the backend is listening on [localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8080/),
but it's possible to change that in the .env file, and the frontend has to know about that,
so we pass it as an environment variable.

```bash
cd frontend
export SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 && trunk serve
```

### Or combined

```bash
./start.sh
```

Visit [Localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).
